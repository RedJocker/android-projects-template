<h2 style="text-align: center;">About</h2>

<p>In this stage, we will add the galleryButton as well as imageView to display image chosen from the gallery. 
    The user should be able to load any image from his gallery to imageView.
    In your virtual device you probably don't have any images saved in your gallery folder, so to test your application properly use
    default camera app.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>
    Add the following components to the application layout:

    Button for opening your gallery folder with the id attribute btnGallery
    ImageView which will display gallery image with the id attribute ivPhoto
    Then you need to add OnClick method to your the galleryButton. It should launch new Intent like:
    Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK, MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI)

    Then you need to code what happens when this activity returns some result 
    resultLauncher = registerForActivityResult(StartActivityForResult()) { result ->
    if (result.resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK)
    { ... }
    }
    That is mainly setting  URI of ivPhoto to the returned URI .
    Generally you must google how to do this stuff.
