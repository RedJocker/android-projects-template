<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, we will add another feature &mdash; the&nbsp;<strong>contrast filter</strong>.</p>

<p>When the contrast is at the minimum, it means that all pixels have the same brightness value. Maximum contrast infers that the difference between the darkest and brightest pixel is at the maximum: one is <code>0</code>, and the other is <code>255</code>.</p>

<p>To adjust contrast, we must be able to highlight/play down the brightness of each pixel taking into consideration the average image brightness. The average brightness is calculated for the whole image, that is, there is only one average brightness for one image. The catch is, both filters should affect each other and work at the same time.</p>

<p>Adding another filter means another slider that will change the&nbsp;contrast value.</p>

<p>More on contrast can be found in the article&nbsp;<a href="https://theailearner.com/2019/01/30/what-is-contrast-in-image-processing/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">What is Contrast in Image Processing?</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;TheAILearner.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Add the following components to the application layout:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Another&nbsp;<code>Slider</code>&nbsp;widget for specifying the photo&nbsp;contrast.&nbsp;Set its&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;attribute as&nbsp;<code>slContrast</code>; the values may vary from <code>-250</code>&nbsp;to <code>250</code>&nbsp;with the step size of <code>10</code>&nbsp;and the initial value of <code>0</code>;</li>
	<li>The contrast filter values&nbsp;are calculated in the following way:</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="math-tex">\[red = alpha \times (Red - avgBright) + avgBright \\ green = alpha \times (Green - avgBright) + avgBright \\ blue = alpha \times (Blue - avgBright) + avgBright\]</span></p>

<p>where:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\[alpha = \frac{(255 + contrast)}{(255 - contrast)}\]</span>and:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\[avgBright = the\ average\ image\ brightness\]</span></p>

<p>Contrast is the current state of the slider value. Once again tests allow some margin rounding error; it&#39;s recommended to use <code>ints</code>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Order of filters matters. To pass the tests, filters must be applied in the following order: <code>brightnessFilter</code> -&gt; <code>contrastFilter</code>;</li>
	<li>Color values should not get out of bounds: <code>[0, 255]</code>;</li>
	<li>The <code>avgBrightness</code> should be calculated after brightness filter has already been applied.</li>
</ul>
