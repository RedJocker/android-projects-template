<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, we will add another filter&nbsp;- <strong>contrast filter</strong>.<br />
A contrast value of&nbsp;<strong>0&nbsp;</strong>means that all pixels have the same brightness value. A contrast value of&nbsp;<strong>1&nbsp;</strong>means that the difference between the highest brightness and lowest brightness is 255.<br />
To regulate contrast we must be able to spread/tight up each pixel brightness from the average image brightness.<br />
Contrast filter isn&#39;t really&nbsp;harder&nbsp;to implement than brightness filter, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily&nbsp; mean this stage difficulty is the same as stage 2.<br />
The catch is, both filter should effect each other and work at the same time.<br />
Also another filter means we will add&nbsp;yet another slider which will regulate the <strong>contrast value</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Add the following components to the application layout:</p>

<ol>
	<li><code>Slider</code>&nbsp;widget for specifying the photo <strong>contrast</strong> with the&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;attribute&nbsp;<code>slContrast</code>; the values range from -250&nbsp;to 250&nbsp;with the step size 10&nbsp;and initial value 0</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>contrast filter values&nbsp;</strong>can be calculated in the following way:</p>

<p>R&nbsp;= alpha*(R - avg_bright) + avg_bright<br />
G&nbsp;= alpha*(G - avg_bright) + avg_bright<br />
B&nbsp;= alpha*(B - avg_bright) + avg_bright</p>

<p><strong>where: </strong><br />
alpha = (255+<strong>contrast</strong>)/(255-<strong>contrast</strong>)<br />
avg_bright = average image brightness</p>

<p><strong>contrast&nbsp;</strong>is simply current contrast slider value.</p>

<p>Once again test allow some margin rounding error, but it&#39;s recommended to use just Ints.</p>
