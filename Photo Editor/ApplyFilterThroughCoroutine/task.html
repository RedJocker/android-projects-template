<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, we will make use of one of Kotlin's most prominent features  - <strong>coroutines</strong>.<br>
Applying filters should no longer freeze UI, it should be done in the background.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Make sure you have the following dependencies added to the build.gradle file</p>

<ol>
	<li><code>implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.3.9")</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Then you need to invoke your filter applier function asynchronously through for example <strong>CoroutineScope.</strong><br>
Also there won't be any tests with big images, but if you want your app not to go out of memory very quickly with let's say 3264x2248 pictures then you must also implement proper scale down function to like 1224 width, 1632 height while maintaining picture aspect ratio.</p>

<p>The tests depend on the start bitmap so it's not necessary to do this.</p>

<p>The difference coroutines make in this app will start to be  noticeable on medium size pictures</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>App should not be lagging at all, regardless of image size, while swiping sliders.</p>

<p>Before: (slider value text lags while swiping slider)</p>
