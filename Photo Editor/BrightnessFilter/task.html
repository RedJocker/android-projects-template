<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
	In this stage, we will implement our first filter - <strong>brightness filter</strong>.<br/>
	Image <strong>brightness</strong> is simply the average RGB value <code>(red + green + blue) / 3</code><br/>
	To increase/decrease it simply add/subtract the same amount from each rgb color.<br/>
	We will regulate image&nbsp;<strong>brightness&nbsp;</strong>with a slider.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		Add a <code>Slider</code>&nbsp;widget for specifying the photo brightness&nbsp;with
		the&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;attribute&nbsp;<code>slBrightness</code>;
		the values range from -250&nbsp;to 250&nbsp;with the step size 10&nbsp;and initial value 0
	</li>
	<li>
		Attach onChangeListener to this slider, that will apply&nbsp;<strong>brightness filter</strong>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>The Brightness filter</strong> should simply add the current value of
		<strong>brightnessSlider</strong> to each RGB value of the default photo bitmap
		and check whether the new value is in the correct boundaries (0,255).
	</li>
	<li>
		Remember that every time a user loads a new image you must save it&#39;s default
		<code>Bitmap</code>&nbsp;and operate on it while applying a brightness filter
		(not on current <code>Bitmap</code>, because filter will erase image details).
	</li>
	<li>
		Lastly, tests allow some margin error because of possible differences that may
		occur due to rounding numbers, but try to use Integers as much as possible,
		otherwise use Double (won&#39;t be needed in this stage though).
	</li>
</ol>
